##Simone##
An OS X Dashboard widget that behaves like Simon(TM).  It was my first attempt, years ago, to create a widget.  It is currently broken (it works in dashcode but not as a widget on some machines).  Project needs to be updated to use today's standards for javascript and not old school global var approach.  Again, this was a first attempt and I brute forced it.
